I started as a developer in 2013 when I passed into an intern program in Sulamérica Seguros since then, I've been at Sendas S.A. where I've developed the features of an ERP aimed at exporting and reprocessing coffee.

I've also worked at Americanas SA developing high-performance applications focused on scalability scenarios.

I have strong experience in event-driven architectures and large data indexing, if you have a little time, you can watch me talk more about this on [The Developers Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCRHdxu8E7o).

Now I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Quinto Andar](https://www.linkedin.com/company/quintoandar-com-br/) and I'm developing applications aimed at the top of the real estate sales funnel and learning a lot to work oriented to digital products.

That's all, folks !
