### Hi there ! I'm Joyce.

Here you can find somethings about me and my career as Software Engineer ðŸ’»

I started as a developer in 2013 when i pass  to intern program in SulamÃ©rica Seguros since then, I've been at Sendas S.A. where I've developed the features of an ERP aimed at exporting and reprocessing coffee.

I also worked at Americanas SA working with high-performance applications focused on scalability scenarios and event-oriented architectures.

And now I work as a Software Engineer at Quinto Andar and I'm developing applications aimed at the top of the real estate sales funnel and learning a lot to work oriented to digital products.
