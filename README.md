I have two female pets 🐶 😽 <br>
I love cooking and watching documentaries of the most random topics you can imagine !


I started as a developer in 2013 when i pass  to intern program in Sulamérica Seguros since then, I've been at Sendas S.A. where I've developed the features of an ERP aimed at exporting and reprocessing coffee.

I also worked at Americanas SA working with high-performance applications focused on scalability scenarios and event-oriented architectures.

Now I work as a Software Engineer at [Quinto Andar](https://www.linkedin.com/company/quintoandar-com-br/) and I'm developing applications aimed at the top of the real estate sales funnel and learning a lot to work oriented to digital products.
